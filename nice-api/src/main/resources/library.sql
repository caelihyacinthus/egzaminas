He particularly commends the Dutch refusal to introduce individual property rights to land.

This book teaches you how. Chapters one through five cover the architecture of the JCE and JCA, symmetric and asymmetric key encryption in Java, message authentication codes, and how to create Java implementations with the API provided by the Bouncy Castle ASN.1 packages, all with plenty of examples. Building on that foundation, the second half of the book takes you into higher-level topics, enabling you to create and implement secure Java applications and make use of standard protocols such as CMS, SSL, and S/MIME. What you will learn from this book How to understand and use JCE, JCA, and the JSSE for encryption and authentication The ways in which padding mechanisms work in ciphers and how to spot and fix typical errors An understanding of how authentication mechanisms are implemented in Java and why they are used Methods for describing cryptographic objects with ASN.1 How to create certificate revocation lists and use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Real-world Web solutions using Bouncy Castle APIs Who this book is for This book is for Java developers who want to use cryptography in their applications or to understand how cryptography is being used in Java applications.

It has a few interesting insights on the situation at the time of the author\'s visit (1889), such as the prosperous appearance of the Javanese, especially the children, the domination of trade by women, and the absence of any sign of Islam. But its main interest is the author\'s favorable opinion of the economic management of Java by the Dutch, as compared with the British in India. He particularly commends the Dutch refusal to introduce individual property rights to land. He does predict however (correctly) that the growth of Java\'s population will lead to economic problems in the future.

This book teaches you how. Chapters one through five cover the architecture of the JCE and JCA, symmetric and asymmetric key encryption in Java, message authentication codes, and how to create Java implementations with the API provided by the Bouncy Castle ASN.1 packages, all with plenty of examples. Building on that foundation, the second half of the book takes you into higher-level topics, enabling you to create and implement secure Java applications and make use of standard protocols such as CMS, SSL, and S/MIME. What you will learn from this book How to understand and use JCE, JCA, and the JSSE for encryption and authentication The ways in which padding mechanisms work in ciphers and how to spot and fix typical errors An understanding of how authentication mechanisms are implemented in Java and why they are used Methods for describing cryptographic objects with ASN.1 How to create certificate revocation lists and use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Real-world Web solutions using Bouncy Castle APIs Who this book is for This book is for Java developers who want to use cryptography in their applications or to understand how cryptography is being used in Java applications. Knowledge of the Java language is necessary, but you need not be familiar with any of the APIs discussed. Wrox Beginning guides are crafted to make learning programming languages and technologies easier than you think, providing a structured, tutorial format that will guide you through all the techniques involved.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WLLAD2FKH3IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',482,'2008-04-21','978-0-362-71024-3'),(243,'Henry Scott Boys','Some Notes on Java and Its Administration by the Dutch','This modestly-entitled work by a former member of the Bengal Civil Service is in fact more like a well-researched essay than a miscellaneous collection of notes. It pays considerable attention to Java\'s history, though its coverage is rather patchy by modern standards, and many names are mis-spelled. It has a few interesting insights on the situation at the time of the author\'s visit (1889), such as the prosperous appearance of the Javanese, especially the children, the domination of trade by women, and the absence of any sign of Islam. But its main interest is the author\'s favorable opinion of the economic management of Java by the Dutch, as compared with the British in India. He particularly commends the Dutch refusal to introduce individual property rights to land. He does predict however (correctly) that the growth of Java\'s population will lead to economic problems in the future. He is also unusual among British colonial administrators of the 19th century in suggesting that the Western way of doing things is not invariably the best one.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3r5GAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',104,'1892-01-01','978-1-85619-152-4'),(244,'Egerton K.

This book teaches you how. Chapters one through five cover the architecture of the JCE and JCA, symmetric and asymmetric key encryption in Java, message authentication codes, and how to create Java implementations with the API provided by the Bouncy Castle ASN.1 packages, all with plenty of examples. Building on that foundation, the second half of the book takes you into higher-level topics, enabling you to create and implement secure Java applications and make use of standard protocols such as CMS, SSL, and S/MIME. What you will learn from this book How to understand and use JCE, JCA, and the JSSE for encryption and authentication The ways in which padding mechanisms work in ciphers and how to spot and fix typical errors An understanding of how authentication mechanisms are implemented in Java and why they are used Methods for describing cryptographic objects with ASN.1 How to create certificate revocation lists and use the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) Real-world Web solutions using Bouncy Castle APIs Who this book is for This book is for Java developers who want to use cryptography in their applications or to understand how cryptography is being used in Java applications. Knowledge of the Java language is necessary, but you need not be familiar with any of the APIs discussed. Wrox Beginning guides are crafted to make learning programming languages and technologies easier than you think, providing a structured, tutorial format that will guide you through all the techniques involved.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WLLAD2FKH3IC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',482,'2008-04-21','978-1-258-63498-8'),(318,'Henry Scott Boys','Some Notes on Java and Its Administration by the Dutch','This modestly-entitled work by a former member of the Bengal Civil Service is in fact more like a well-researched essay than a miscellaneous collection of notes. It pays considerable attention to Java\'s history, though its coverage is rather patchy by modern standards, and many names are mis-spelled. It has a few interesting insights on the situation at the time of the author\'s visit (1889), such as the prosperous appearance of the Javanese, especially the children, the domination of trade by women, and the absence of any sign of Islam. But its main interest is the author\'s favorable opinion of the economic management of Java by the Dutch, as compared with the British in India. He particularly commends the Dutch refusal to introduce individual property rights to land. He does predict however (correctly) that the growth of Java\'s population will lead to economic problems in the future. He is also unusual among British colonial administrators of the 19th century in suggesting that the Western way of doing things is not invariably the best one.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3r5GAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',104,'1892-01-01','978-1-193-23236-2'),(319,'Egerton K.

It pays considerable attention to Java\'s history, though its coverage is rather patchy by modern standards, and many names are mis-spelled. It has a few interesting insights on the situation at the time of the author\'s visit (1889), such as the prosperous appearance of the Javanese, especially the children, the domination of trade by women, and the absence of any sign of Islam. But its main interest is the author\'s favorable opinion of the economic management of Java by the Dutch, as compared with the British in India. He particularly commends the Dutch refusal to introduce individual property rights to land. He does predict however (correctly) that the growth of Java\'s population will lead to economic problems in the future. He is also unusual among British colonial administrators of the 19th century in suggesting that the Western way of doing things is not invariably the best one.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3r5GAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',104,'1892-01-01','978-1-60108-702-7'),(428,'Egerton K.

The authors also present functional design as a way of writing algorithms for the class responsibilities that are assigned in the object-oriented design. Click here for downloadable student files This book has been developed from the ground up to be a Java text, rather than a Java translation of prior works. The text uses real Java I/O classes and treats event handling as a fundamental control structure that is introduced right from the beginning. The authors carefully guide the student through the process of declaring a reference variable, instantiating an object and assigning it to the variable. Students will gradually develop a complete and comprehensive understanding of what an object is, how it works, and what constitutes a well-designed class interface.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OQGNOrzDKhQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',812,'2003-01-01','978-1-78004-655-6'),(530,'T.

This new edition of the classic Java Threads shows you how to take full advantage of Java\'s threading facilities and brings you up-to-date with the watershed changes in Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). It provides a thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.Java\'s threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.You\'ll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.Java Threads, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded and revised. It incorporates the concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent throughout. New chapters cover thread performance, using threads with Swing, threads and Collection classes, thread pools, and threads and I/O (traditional, new, and interrupted). Developers who cannot yet deploy J2SE 5.0 can use thread utilities provided in the Appendix to achieve similar functionality with earlier versions of Java.Topics include: Lock starvation and deadlock detection Atomic classes and minimal synchronization (J2SE 5.0) Interaction of Java threads with Swing, I/O, and Collection classes Programmatically controlled locks and condition variables (J2SE 5.0) Thread performance and security Thread pools (J2SE 5.0) Thread groups Platform-specific thread scheduling Task schedulers (J2SE 5.0) Parallelizing loops for multiprocessor machines In short, this new edition of Java Threads covers everything you need to know about threads, from the simplest animation program to the most complex applications. If you plan to do any serious work in Java, you will find this book invaluable.Scott Oaks is a senior software engineer for the Java Performance Engineering group at Sun Microsystems and the author of four books in the O\'Reilly Java series.Formerly a senior systems engineer at Sun Microsystems, Henry Wong is an independent consultant working on various Java related projects.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r8hhO7oGKrEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',361,'2004-09-10','978-1-326-86058-5'),(546,'David Wyllie','The Encyclopaedia Britannica: Ita to Lor',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4KVV1x0q8KUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',1038,'1911-01-01','978-1-5438-9661-9'),(547,'Hugh Chisholm','The Encyclopaedia Britannica',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7T8OAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',1016,'1911-01-01','978-1-322-57470-7'),(548,'Arthur Mee','China.

In the present scenario, such a language and programming environment has come to exist seemingly. Java is a type of Internet programming language which has made it possible to access the entire world from any corner around the globe. Java has been designed and developed by James Gosling and his team consisting of members, namely Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, collectively known as the Green Team in 1995 for the company Sun Microsystems. This programming language was based on C and C++ language syntax, which made it easy for programmers to learn this language. Java is a highly sophisticated programming language that aids the programmers in expressing their complex ideas quickly. Many types of programming languages are available like C, C++, MySQL, R, Python, and others, but Java is used extensively over other programming languages because of a variety of advantages of using Java.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V9D8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',20,'2017-05-26','978-1-55128-541-2'),(552,'Connecticut.

Nullability is important, collections are different, and classes are final by default. Kotlin is more functional, but what does that mean, and how should it change the way that you program? And what about all that Java code that you still have to support? Your tour guides Duncan and Nat first made the trip in 2015, and they\'ve since helped many teams and individuals follow in their footsteps. Travel with them as they break the route down into legs like Optional to Nullable, Beans to Values, and Open to Sealed Classes. Each explains a key concept and then shows how to refactor production Java to idiomatic Kotlin, gradually and safely, while maintaining interoperability. The resulting code is simpler, more expressive, and easier to change.

The platform choice is not random, because they represent, to a certain extent, competition between UNIX-like and Windows systems, which largely defined software evolution over the last decade. Although Java applications run on Windows, and there exist UNIX bridges for .NET, the Java/UNIX and .NET/Windows combinations are used for development of a significant portion (if not majority) of applications on their respective operating systems, so both platforms deserve a careful examination of their capabilities.Such an examination is especially important since different aspects of UNIX/Windows and Java/.NET competition have been flaming endless heated debates between proponents of both camps, which often blindly deny merits of the opposite side while at the same time praising their preferred solution.

It pays considerable attention to Java\'s history, though its coverage is rather patchy by modern standards, and many names are mis-spelled. It has a few interesting insights on the situation at the time of the author\'s visit (1889), such as the prosperous appearance of the Javanese, especially the children, the domination of trade by women, and the absence of any sign of Islam. But its main interest is the author\'s favorable opinion of the economic management of Java by the Dutch, as compared with the British in India. He particularly commends the Dutch refusal to introduce individual property rights to land. He does predict however (correctly) that the growth of Java\'s population will lead to economic problems in the future. He is also unusual among British colonial administrators of the 19th century in suggesting that the Western way of doing things is not invariably the best one.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3r5GAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',104,'1892-01-01','978-0-7147-3228-2'),(690,'Egerton K.

This new edition of the classic Java Threads shows you how to take full advantage of Java\'s threading facilities and brings you up-to-date with the watershed changes in Java 2 Standard Edition version 5.0 (J2SE 5.0). It provides a thorough, step-by-step approach to threads programming.Java\'s threading system is simple relative to other threading systems. In earlier versions of Java, this simplicity came with tradeoffs: some of the advanced features in other threading systems were not available in Java. J2SE 5.0 changes all that: it provides a large number of new thread-related classes that make the task of writing multithreaded programs that much easier.You\'ll learn where to use threads to increase efficiency, how to use them effectively, and how to avoid common mistakes. This book discusses problems like deadlock, race conditions, and starvation in detail, helping you to write code without hidden bugs.Java Threads, Third Edition, has been thoroughly expanded and revised. It incorporates the concurrency utilities from java.util.concurrent throughout. New chapters cover thread performance, using threads with Swing, threads and Collection classes, thread pools, and threads and I/O (traditional, new, and interrupted). Developers who cannot yet deploy J2SE 5.0 can use thread utilities provided in the Appendix to achieve similar functionality with earlier versions of Java.Topics include: Lock starvation and deadlock detection Atomic classes and minimal synchronization (J2SE 5.0) Interaction of Java threads with Swing, I/O, and Collection classes Programmatically controlled locks and condition variables (J2SE 5.0) Thread performance and security Thread pools (J2SE 5.0) Thread groups Platform-specific thread scheduling Task schedulers (J2SE 5.0) Parallelizing loops for multiprocessor machines In short, this new edition of Java Threads covers everything you need to know about threads, from the simplest animation program to the most complex applications. If you plan to do any serious work in Java, you will find this book invaluable.Scott Oaks is a senior software engineer for the Java Performance Engineering group at Sun Microsystems and the author of four books in the O\'Reilly Java series.Formerly a senior systems engineer at Sun Microsystems, Henry Wong is an independent consultant working on various Java related projects.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=r8hhO7oGKrEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',361,'2004-09-10','978-1-5499-3173-4'),(791,'Stephen Hawking','The Encyclopaedia Britannica: Ita to Lor',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=4KVV1x0q8KUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',1038,'1911-01-01','978-1-6770-6692-6'),(792,'Hugh Chisholm','The Encyclopaedia Britannica',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=7T8OAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',1016,'1911-01-01','978-1-85672-976-5'),(793,'Arthur Mee','China.

In the present scenario, such a language and programming environment has come to exist seemingly. Java is a type of Internet programming language which has made it possible to access the entire world from any corner around the globe. Java has been designed and developed by James Gosling and his team consisting of members, namely Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton, collectively known as the Green Team in 1995 for the company Sun Microsystems. This programming language was based on C and C++ language syntax, which made it easy for programmers to learn this language. Java is a highly sophisticated programming language that aids the programmers in expressing their complex ideas quickly. Many types of programming languages are available like C, C++, MySQL, R, Python, and others, but Java is used extensively over other programming languages because of a variety of advantages of using Java.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=V9D8DwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',20,'2024-04-03','978-1-78375-415-1'),(797,'Johann Wolfgang von Goethe','Journal & Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal','Includes section \"Numismatic supplement,\" no. 5-45 (previously issued in the society\'s Journal, later in its Journal, 3rd ser.).','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JttHAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',430,'1906-01-01','978-0-551-39604-3'),(798,'Joseph Conrad','Sugar Central and Planters News',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Z-9NAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',812,'1928-01-01','978-1-4192-5286-0'),(799,'Alexander Hume Ford','The Mid-Pacific Magazine ...',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=fFVBAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',768,'1919-01-01','978-1-297-90353-3'),(800,'Alice Walker','Bulletin of the Bureau of Agricultural Intelligence and of Plant-Diseases',NULL,'http://books.google.com/books/content?id=55ZPAQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api',1478,'1910-01-01','978-1-242-62263-2'),(801,'New York (State).

If you\'re an experienced Java developer who has tried the Kotlin language, you were probably productive in about the same time. You\'ll have found that they do things differently in Kotlin, though. Nullability is important, collections are different, and classes are final by default. Kotlin is more functional, but what does that mean, and how should it change the way that you program? And what about all that Java code that you still have to support? Your tour guides Duncan and Nat first made the trip in 2015, and they\'ve since helped many teams and individuals follow in their footsteps. Travel with them as they break the route down into legs like Optional to Nullable, Beans to Values, and Open to Sealed Classes. Each explains a key concept and then shows how to refactor production Java to idiomatic Kotlin, gradually and safely, while maintaining interoperability. The resulting code is simpler, more expressive, and easier to change. By the end of the journey, you\'ll be confident in refactoring Java to Kotlin, writing Kotlin from scratch, and managing a mixed language codebase as it evolves over time.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6d09EAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api',396,'2021-08-15','978-0-910411-52-3'),(840,'Herbert Schildt','Java: A Beginner\'s Guide, Sixth Edition (INKLING CH)','Essential Java Programming Skills--Made Easy!

The platform choice is not random, because they represent, to a certain extent, competition between UNIX-like and Windows systems, which largely defined software evolution over the last decade. Although Java applications run on Windows, and there exist UNIX bridges for .NET, the Java/UNIX and .NET/Windows combinations are used for development of a significant portion (if not majority) of applications on their respective operating systems, so both platforms deserve a careful examination of their capabilities.Such an examination is especially important since different aspects of UNIX/Windows and Java/.NET competition have been flaming endless heated debates between proponents of both camps, which often blindly deny merits of the opposite side while at the same time praising their preferred solution. The material here is purposely structured by general categories of protection mechanism and reviewing each platform$B!G(Bs features in those areas. This allows starting each topic with a platform-neutral security concept and performing relatively deep drill-downs for each technology without losing track of the overall focus of providing an unbiased side-by-side comparison.The document is based on the research material that was used as a foundation of the feature article, \"Securing .NET and Enterprise Java: Side by Side\", which was written by Vincent Dovydaitis and myself and appeared in Numbers 3-4 of Computer Security Journal in 2002.
